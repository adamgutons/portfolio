# Welcome...

Welcome to my digital space! I am a seasoned software engineer with expertise in Java, Python, and a suite of frameworks 
and tools that power my passion for crafting efficient and scalable solutions. From spearheading microservices 
development in Digital Construction Management to pioneering automation scripts for geospatial solutions, my journey is 
marked by technical diversity.

In my current role, I architecture scalable microservices, implement ETL procedures, and champion the 
adoption of open-source software. In other roles I have led the development of robust scripts and web services, 
enhancing automation and software development lifecycle practices. I have additional experience crafting 
MVC web applications, leveraging Java EE, and designing intuitive interfaces for seamless data transfer.
