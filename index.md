# Welcome...

Welcome to my digital space! I am a seasoned software engineer with expertise in Java, Python, and a suite of frameworks 
and tools that power my passion for crafting efficient and scalable solutions. From spearheading microservices 
development in Digital Construction Management to pioneering automation scripts for geospatial solutions, my journey is 
marked by technical diversity.

In my current role, I architecture scalable microservices, implement ETL procedures, and champion the 
adoption of open-source software. In other roles I have led the development of robust scripts and web services, 
enhancing automation and software development lifecycle practices. I have additional experience crafting 
MVC web applications, leveraging Java EE, and designing intuitive interfaces for seamless data transfer.

My academic background in Computer Information Technology and a Bachelor's in English with a minor in Geology 
underscores a holistic approach to problem-solving. Join me as I navigate the realms of code, GIS, and technology, 
driven by a relentless curiosity and a dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Let's embark on this digital journey together, where each line of code tells a story of innovation and where technology 
meets the art of problem-solving.  Take a look at my "About Me" for more about my personal interests and my "Projects"
page for current work that I noodle on in my free time.
