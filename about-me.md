# About Me...

Hello there! Beyond the tech world here is a snapshot of who I am.

First and foremost, I am a husband and proud father of two young boys.  Family is the most significant thing in my life.
I'm also an avid reader, currently diving into the Dune Series, William Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy, and the classic Lord of the 
Rings Trilogy. Music is also a constant companion. I've been playing the guitar for a decade and drumming for two, exploring 
genres like jazz, funk, blues, rock, and R&B. My current playlists include Deodato, Tom Scott and the LA Express, Jimi Hendrix, 
Funkadelic (my favorite guitarist might be Eddie Hazel), and Bo Diddley.

Outside the digital domain, you'll find me amidst nature â€“ hiking and making an occasional attempt at trail running. I 
am also an amateur gardener.  I built a small garden last summer and plan on expanding this year.  I can claim success
with growing tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and my wife with a variety of house plants.
